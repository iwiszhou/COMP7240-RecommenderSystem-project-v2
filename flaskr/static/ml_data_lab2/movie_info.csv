One of the most spectacular and renowned conductors of the 30s, Furtwangler's reputation rivaled that of Toscanini's. After the war, he was investigated as part of the Allies' de-Nazification programme. In the bombed-out Berlin of the immediate post-war period, the Allies slowly bring law and order--and justice--to bear on an occupied Germany. An American major is given the Furtwangler file, and is told to find everything he can and to prosecute the man ruthlessly. Tough and hard-nosed, Major Steve Arnold sets out to investigate a world of which he knows nothing. Orchestra members vouch for Furtwangler's morality--he did what he could to protect Jewish players from his orchestra. To the Germans, deeply respectful of their musical heritage, Furtwangler was a demigod; to Major Arnold, he is just a lying, weak-willed Nazi."|https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmE5MGVjMWEtZWQ4Ny00OTc0LTg4OWQtNWZhYzlkMGFjMjFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTYwMTcxOTYy._UX512.jpg|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

62662|Tokyo-Ga|1985|"Wim Wenders says, If in our century something sacred still existedâ¦ if there were something like a sacred treasure of the cinema, then for me that would have to be the work of the Japanese director, Yasujiro Ozu. He made fifty-four films. Silent films in the Twenties, black-and-white films in the Thirties and Forties, and finally colour films until his death on December 12th, 1963, on his sixtieth birthday. Ozu's work does not need my praise and such a sacred treasure of the cinema could only reside in the realm of the imagination. And so, my trip to Tokyo was in no way a pilgrimage. I was curious as to whether I still could track down something from this time, whether there was still anything left of this work. Images perhaps, or even peopleâ¦ Or whether so much would have changed in Tokyo in the twenty years since Ozu's death that nothing would be left to find."|https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyMDMwNjcyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg2MzkwMzE@._UX512.jpg|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0

To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroesâa washed-up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)âwho are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse."|https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MTI5NjQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU1OTU0OQ@@._UX512.jpg|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0
